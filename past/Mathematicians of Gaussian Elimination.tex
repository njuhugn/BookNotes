\textcolor{red}{An independent origin in modern Europe has had three phases.}
\begin{itemize}
\item First came the schoolbook lesson, beginning with \textbf{Isaac Newton}.
\item Next were methods for professional hand computers, which began with \textbf{Carl Friedrich Gauss}, who apparently was inspired by work of \textbf{Joseph Louis Lagrange}.
\item Last was the interpretation in matrix algebra by several authors, including \textbf{John von Neumann}.

\item John Todd (1911-2007) lectured on Jensen¡¯s work in 1946.
\item Alan Turing (1912-1954) described it in the way universities now teach it.
\item George Forsythe (1917-1972) called it ¡°Gaussian elimination¡±.
